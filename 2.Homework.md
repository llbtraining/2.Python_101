Objective:
==========
Create a python script that checks the cpu usage of crond every second, and dump the result in a csv file. First column is the time stamp in epoch, second column is the cpu usage

you may want to:
- use the os module and make os calls using ps and grep
- use the time module
- be comfortable with conditional statements, loops and manipulating strings
- know how to write a file


Bonus points: 
=============
- Use functions
- make your script handle/respond the SIGTERM signal we discuss in the previous course.
- make a configuration file that would allow to specify a different process to monitor and different dump frequency (other than every second)
